Falls is a serious problem of public health that affects mainly the elderly population, in which is related to the loss of confidence, self-esteem and autonomy.

Thinking about it, the \textit{SafeWatch} was developed as a fall detection systems embedded in smartwatches already in the market. The proposed system will monitor the elderly through sensors present in the smartwatch, and when it detects a fall, it will  vibrates on the user's wrist and report to a list of emergency contacts the location and the possibility of the elderly to be in a dangerous situation.
