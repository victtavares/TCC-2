In Brazil and several other countries worldwide the elderly population is growing, and with that, their wish to be more independent. Being a niche of the population much more susceptible to falls and problems derived from this event, this paper proposes a fall detection system embedded in smartwatchs already present on the market. The proposed system will monitor the elderly through sensor present in the smartwatchs, more specifically the gyroscope and accelerometer, and through the fall detection algorithm, it will report to the user's contact list his location and an alert informing that the elderly is in dangerous situation. The confiability of the proposed application is evaluated through the values of \textit{Sensitivity} and \textit{Specificity}.
